# Classification-Of-Arrhythmia-Based-On-ECG-Signal
A crucial step in the diagnosis of cardiovascular anarchy is
the inquisition and technology of ECG signals. Ramification
is the elementary reference of exploration in this discipline,
and deep neural networks are increasingly countenancing it.
A deep neural network was manufactured in this study to
automatically to classify premier ECG signals. The study
was driven using information from an MIT-BIH database.
Five different neural network architectures were used: the
convolutional neural network was the first, AlexNet was the
second, LSTM was the third, LeNet was the fourth, and the
VGG was the fifth. Training and test sets were split up into the
dataset in proportions of 80% and 20%, respectively. In our
investigation, CNN and VGG accomplished better, with the
accuracy rates of 97.9 percent and 97.8 percent, respectively.
We also oversee that why LSTM, a particular RNN variant
used in deep learning algorithms to categorize cardiovascular
distempers into five groups, performed infirmly.
